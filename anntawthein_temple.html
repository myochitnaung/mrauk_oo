    <h2>Ann Taw Thein Temple</h2>

    <p>
        The Andaw Pagoda of Mrauk U means the Pagoda enshrining the tooth-relic of Buddha. The pagoda is located about
        86 feet from the Shittaung Pagoda in the north-east direction. Min Hla Raza was the original builder of this
        pagoda in 1521 A.D. Due to some damaged parts. the King of Mrauk U. Minrazagyi reconstructed this pagoda in 1596
        A.D. The central tower of the shrine contains the tooth-relic of Buddha. It was originally obtained from Sri
        Lanka by King Minbin (1534-1542 A.D.)

        circular pagodas. built of bricks stand on the platforms of south. north and west of the shrine. On the east.

        prayer hall from the outer court. The east facade of the shrine measures 31 feet from north to south and is only
        14 feet high from the ground to the roof. On each side of the entrance are three niches which get into the wall.

        row of smaller niches at the height of 7. four to each side. and the niches hold stone images of Buddha. From
        the inner side of the gallery a vaulted passage leads from north. south. east. and west to the inner chamber.
