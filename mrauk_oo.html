    <h2><u> History</u></h2>

    <p>
        In 1433, King Min Saw Mon established Mrauk U as the capital of the last unified Arakanese Kingdom. The city
        eventually reached a size of 160,000 in the early seventeenth century.[8] Mrauk U served as the capital of the
        Mrauk U kingdom and its 49 kings till the conquest of the kingdom by the Burmese Konbaung Dynasty in 1784.

        During British colonial rule, Mrauk U was known as "Mrohaung" or "Myohaung".[citation needed] The area was the
        site of fighting during the Arakan Campaign, in the latter part of the Second World War.

        On 16 January 2018, Rakhine protesters rioted near a government building in Mrauk U after a ban was issued by
        local authorities on an event that commemorated the anniversary of the Kingdom of Mrauk U's dissolution.[9][10]
        In response to protesters attempting to seize the government building, police fired live ammunition into the
        crowd, killing seven and wounding twelve.[11][12]

    <h2><u>Trading</u></h2>

    <p>
        Due to its proximity to the Bay of Bengal, Mrauk U developed into an important regional trade hub, acting as
        both a back door to the Burmese hinterland and also as an important port along the eastern shore of the Bay of
        Bengal. It became a transit point for goods such as rice, ivory, elephants, tree sap and deer hide from Ava in
        Myanmar, and of cotton, slaves, horses, cowrie, spices and textiles from Bengal, India, Persia and Arabia.
        Alongside Pegu and later Syriam, it was one of the most important ports in Myanmar up until the eighteenth
        century.[citation needed]

        The city also traded with non-Asian powers such as Portugal and then the Dutch East India Company of the
        Netherlands. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) established trading relations with the Arakanese in 1608 after
        the Portuguese fell in favour due to the lack of loyalty of Portuguese mercenaries, such as Filipe de Brito e
        Nicote in the service of the Arakanese king. The VOC established a permanent factory in Mrauk U in 1635, and
        operated in Arakan till 1665.[13]

        At its zenith, Mrauk U was the centre of a kingdom which stretched from the shores of the Ganges river to the
        western reaches of the Ayeyarwaddy River. According to popular Arakanese legend, there were 12 'cities of the
        Ganges' which constitute roughly half of modern-day Bangladesh which were governed by Mrauk U, including Dhaka
        and Chittagong[citation needed]. During that period, its kings minted coins inscribed in Arakanese, Kufic and
        Bengali.

        Much of Mrauk U's historical description is drawn from the writings of Friar Sebastian Manrique, a Portuguese
        Augustinian monk who resided in Mrauk U from 1630 to 1635.

    <h2><u>Religion</u></h2>
    <p>
        As Mrauk U and her kingdom prospered, the kings, ministers and peasants built many pagodas and temples around
        the town to reflect their faith. Thus, Mrauk U houses a rich collection of temples and pagodas second only to
        the Central Burmese town of Bagan, in Myanmar. Most of Mrauk U's temples were constructed of hewn stone bricks,
        unlike the mud and clay bricks of Bagan.

        The most notable temples in Mrauk U are the Shite-thaung Temple (Temple of 80,000 Images or Temple of Victory),
        Htukkanthein Temple (Htukkan Ordination Hall), the Koe-thaung Temple (Temple of 90,000 Images) and the Five Mahn
        pagodas.

        In 2017, an international commission urged Myanmar to nominate Mrauk U for UNESCO World Heritage Site status.
        The proposal is backed by Kofi Annan and archaeologists are now cataloguing and protecting the city's many sites
        in preparation for nomination.[14]
